* Description
This repository intends applying minimal I18N effort to Texinfo files under emacs/doc/* in GNU Emacs distribution.

It is mirrored Emacs repository on git.gnu.savannah.org but includes branches forked from that mirror. These  names are started with "emacs-doc-ja/" (It intends I18N, so -ja may change to -I18N in the future).

For simple briefing(and helping my confused thought), [[./README.png][here] is a simple diagram that shows how this repository will be updated.

alt do once only when target branches are cut.

local->origin: "add @documentlanguage as en to doc/emacs/docstyle.texi\n in emacs-doc-ja/* branches.\n (by cherry-pick 911eccd1407f2a19aede98882eccad6b625bce85)"
end

alt do manually by hand.
local->local: merge target branches commits\n to emacs-doc-ja/*.
local->origin: push emacs-doc-ja*
end

origin-->CI: "build emacs executable by minimal effort(only curiosity meaning)."
